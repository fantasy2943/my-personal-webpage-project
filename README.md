# THIS IS MY PERSONAL WEBPAGE PROJECT WITH 100% RESPONSIVE
This is a required project implemented by freeCodeCamp - one of the largest community to learn to code. I have complete this project before but it does not seem very good. Now I have accomplished it with better things like:
* Clear layout.
* Complete all the requirements of this project.
* 100% responsive design.
* Using Bootstrap.
* Compatible with many browsers(Chrome, Safari, IE...).
* Write code neatly.
* Color, font combination...
